# XXS Survey

In the survey page there's a row in the table that references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(number)">69</a>. The site administrators are not responsible for this.

## Steps
* Go to the survey page.
* Open the inspector.
* Change an option tag value to 69 (this won't work with the first option).
* Select the option you edited.

## Ways to secure
* Validate and sanatize client input.
